# PHP Task List
This is my first PHP project and also my first real contact with back-end development, with help and instructions from the book "Desenvolvimento web com PHP e MySQL" of Evaldo Junior Bento. <br><br><b> However </b>, in order to give myself a challenge and learn more about how to integrate JS and PHP to obtain a better user experience, I decided to <b> structure it as a SPA </b>, using Javascript to make client requests to the database through PHP controllers. All requests are made to the entrance point of the application and relevant data is sent back to dinamically change the contents of the page, just like a SPA should work. Because of this, many aspects of this project differ from the one developed in the book, since I didn't wanted to just copy it, <b> but really learn from it </b>. <br><br> If you have any suggestions of improvement or noticed any security breach in my code, please tell me. I'll be really glad for any help or wisdom I can get. :)
